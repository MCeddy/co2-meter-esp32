# CO2 Meter with ESP32

## Status

:construction: **Still in development!** :construction:

No final version at the moment! :construction_worker: :building_construction:

## Description

Messasure CO2 particles in to the air.

## Features

- ...

## Setup

- connect all parts to the ESP32
- connect power
- the ESP32 starting an own Wifi access point named "co2-meter-{device ID}"
- connect to this Wifi with your smartphone
- use `waaatering` for Wifi password
- you will redirected to a config page
- insert your Wifi and MQTT broker credentials
- click on "save"
- the ESP32 will restarting and connect to your MQTT broker
- after about 60 seconds should you should see a new topic in your MQTT broker `co2-meter/{device ID}/out/info` with a lot of information in the payload

## MQTT API

The whole module is controllable via MQTT protocol. So it's easy to integrate in existing SmartHome systems (like Home Assistant or Node-Red).
